Exercises 2.1 - 2.5

Define a component responsible for formatting a single course called Course, 
must work regardless of the number of parts a course has:

App component, contains the course data and passes it to Course
    Course compoment(prop-course obj),calc total num of exercises using reduce(),delegates to child compoments:      
        Header(course) => course name, 
        Content(parts) => list of Parts components using map() to ensure scalability       
            Parts component (get a single part obj based on part.id) => name, num exercises
        Total(sum) => total num of exercises

Extend our application to allow for an arbitrary number of courses:

Updeated Course compoment in order to accept an array of courses as prop, 
Loop the courses array using map(),
Total calc inside the Total compoment call.
