The student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Implement a web application 
for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.
The application must display the total number of collected feedback for each category.
Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback is allowed to disappear.
More statistics about the gathered feedback: the total number of collected feedback, the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1)
and the percentage of positive feedback.
Components should not be defined inside other components.
Display statistics only once feedback has been gathered.
Button handles the functionality of each feedback submission button.
StatisticLine for displaying a single statistic, e.g. the average score.

useState tracks the number of "good," "neutral," and "bad" feedback.
The Buttons component handles user interaction via buttons and updates the state in the parent (App) using callbacks.
The Statistics component dynamically calculates statistics and displays them based on the state passed from the parent.
If no feedback is given (total === 0), the app displays "No feedback given."
The StatisticLine component renders a single statistic, with a label and a value passed as props.
Statistics Component use StatisticLine for each one.
The positivePercentage value is formatted as a percentage with 1 decimal.
Separating the display logic (StatisticLine) from the calculation logic (Statistics) makes the code modular and reusable.
A table is used for displaying multiple rows of statistics.
